### Objective

*Develop a static website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a framework of your choice between Bootstrap, Foundation, or W3.CSS. The site should simulate the presentation of a fictional applied research project, following principles of usability, accessibility, and user experience.*

### Structure

1. **Home Page**
  - Presentation of the project team (photographs, names, roles) and a brief introduction to the topic (e.g., the members of the group. In the absence of ideas from each student/group, he project topic could be “the thermal ingratitude of potatoes in the production of ecological fuel for aircraft (**joke**)”).
2. **Project Page**
  - Complete description and background of the fictional project.
3. **Partners and Investors Page**
  - List of partner entities, investors, or sponsors (also fictional).
4. **Contact Page**
  - Institutional contact information for the research laboratory (email, phone number, address, also fictional), location map (static or embedded), and a static contact form (name, email, subject, message) to simulate the submission of contact details.

### Technical Requirements

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and one of the frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, or W3.CSS) must be used.
- The site must be responsive and adaptable to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (prioritize mobile devices).
- The navigation menu must be present on all pages.
- Apply best practices for usability, UX, and accessibility (use of alternative text, adequate contrast, readability). See Nielsen's heuristics, Shneiderman's 8 golden rules, and web accessibility principles according to the WCAG2.2 standard.
- Clear and organized code structure (separate HTML, CSS, and JS).
- All pages must be validated according to the HTML5 standard. The customized styles file must be validated according to the CSS3 standard (use W3C validator for each technology).

### Criteria

- Correct writing of HTML and CSS code (valid). Use of semantic elements.
- Design quality and visual consistency (see Nielsen's heuristics, Shneiderman's 8 golden rules, Gestalt principles).
- Degree of interactivity (use of JavaScript).
- Responsiveness and adaptation to different devices.
- Clarity of navigation and page organization.
- Application of accessibility principles (see web accessibility principles according to the WCAG2.2 standard).
- Creativity and originality in the presentation of the theme.
